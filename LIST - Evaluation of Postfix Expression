***********************QUESTION******************************
Given string S representing a postfix expression, the task is to evaluate the expression and find the final value. Operators will only include the basic arithmetic operators like *, /, + and -.

 

Example 1:

Input: S = "231*+9-"
Output: -4
Explanation:
After solving the given expression, 
we have -4 as result.
Example 2:

Input: S = "123+*8-"
Output: -3
Explanation:
After solving the given postfix 
expression, we have -3 as result.

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Complete the function evaluatePostfixExpression() that takes the string S denoting the expression as input parameter and returns the evaluated value.


Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
Expected Auixilliary Space: O(|S|)


Constraints:
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 105

                stack.append(a)
        return stack[-1]
